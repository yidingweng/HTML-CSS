			Alpha is a sushi restaurant in Westmount, Montreal that pairs the purity of traditional Japanese cuisine with Korean and South American flavours. Alpha is one of the only restaurants in Canada influenced by the time-honored tastes, craftsmanship, and knife skills of kaiseki cuisine. A respect for pure, sustainable, and ultrafresh ingredients is the foundation for all our dishes. Aesthetic presentation matters as much to us as deliciousness itself. New tastes, classic methods, conscious eating: Alpha is chef Antonio Alpha.
